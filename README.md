# 22vision

## Purpose
This is a passion project. The purpose of the project is to add visuals to connections described in the Bible. I am starting with mapping Kings and Chronicles. As the application becomes more developed a larger representation of the Bible will also be covered.

## Structure

Currently the application is split into two applications. 

## 22vision

This will be the UI of the application. It is built using Vite, React, and TypeScript. 

## kings-api

This is the first microservice that will be feeding 22vision. It will house information regarding the kings from the Isrealite nations (United, Judah, Isreal). 

Currently kings has 4 models (3 classes and an ENUM)
